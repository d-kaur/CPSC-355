Overall Feedback:
Excellent work! -2 points: I did not see you examine the values of the array before and after sorting in your script using the "x" command.
-10%: late deduction.

Assignment 4: 83/100
Overall Feedback:
Good work! You lost points because:
-3 points: newSphere does not use a local variable + return by value.
-2 points: I did not see you print out the values in the struct before and after function calls inside your script.
-1 point: most subroutines use more bytes than are needed on the stack.
-2 points: print and equal use the wrong registers for passing to subroutines and returning from subroutines.
